I wanted to build a website for a tourist attraction in my local town, 'The Rock of Cashel. The website is to target both tourists and locals. To achieve this, I aimed to lay out the website in a clear and concise way. As most visitors to the 'Rock of Cashel' would be tourists from out of town, I prioritised the History section first with a brief but thorough description of the rocks' past which also includes an image of the rock from oldern times, then a Visit Us section which includes an iframe of Google Maps with admission fees, opening times and facilities available on site. At the bottom of the page I included all relevant contact information with relevant social media links included in the footer. I added two divider images, one under the History section of a tapestry and one under the Visit Us section. I added a hover text overlay effect to the image of the tapestry to give the site visitor some further context as I felt an impressive picture commanded such. The image of the rock under the Visit Us section is taken at sunset which I felt was relevant as the visitor also approaches the end of the web page. The color scheme in both divider images are cohesive and compliment eachother, whilst the landing page image is an impressive picture of the rock with the predominantly grey and green offering a striking effect. The competition page is pitched as a local photo competition for pictures of the rock. I added this to the end of the navigation bar as locals would make up a significantly less amount of visitors on the website. I also wanted to keep the main landing page kept exclusively for easily digestable information on the rock itself.

Created new HTML and CSS files

Added description and added relevant keywords

Added title "Rock of Cashel"

Added header, section and footer to the body element

Imported Amiri font from Google Fonts as it had a classic looks which I felt fitted well with a website based on a historical site

Applied black font to make it stand out against lighter shade background

Added three section elements: one for main image, one for history section and one for visit us section

Added nav links within header element for Home, History, Visit Us and Competition 

Styled navigation links so they were more compatible with the logo. I also played around with different font sizes and letter spacing to see what would suit best.

Found it difficult to crop the picture to a size that fitted the page but was happy after going through some trial and error with the result

Added the section 'History' which included information about the Rock of Cashel. I created a set of paragraphs for the text with line breaks between. I also added the class "history" to edit in css.

Matched the font size of the 'History' title with that of the logo and used the same margins.

Alligned the picture in the 'history' section to the right and wrapped text around it. I struggled to wrap the text around the picture at first but found relevant information on https://www.uvm.edu/~bnelson/computer/css/wrappingtextaroundimages.html

Created a third section titled Visit Us

Placed image between History and Visit Us to divide the flow

Added internal nav link for history nav bar at top of page using information sourced from https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000049.htm

Added iframe for Google Maps with the location set to that of 'The Rock of Cashel'

Added Admission Prices and Opening times beside map

Added font awesome script to add icons 

Added list of facilities under opening times, besdie map

Added relevant icons to all Visit us lists

Added evening picture of 'Rock of Cashel' to alert coming to end of page

First picture I attempted was too large so I decided to use one that covered width but not the height

Added inline block element after reading back over lesson on block elements

Added social media icons in footer. I acquired accurate colors using https://brandpalettes.com/

Put the banner image above 'Visit Us' into it's own section as I wanted tp put a hover text overlay css style over it

Followed tutorial here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exb2ab72Xhs to acheive hover transition effect over tapestry image

After spending a bit of time acheieving the desired effect, I decided it was taking too much time when I started to adjust the layout for different screen sizes so instead I opted for text to remain in corner of image as a descriptor.














Welcome conorwalsh1,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI you can use:

`heroku login -i`

If you have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled then use the API key that was generated for you at [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account) as your password.
This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidently make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
